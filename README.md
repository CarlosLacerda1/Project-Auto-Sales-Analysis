# Auto Sales Analysis Project

(image) [

## Intro
This project comprehends a data analysis of auto store sales utilizing different tools like Python, Power BI and SQL. The goal of this project is to provide an analysis which could be useful for business decision taking. The data was manipulated in sql and visualized in a power bi dashboard. This data comprises the sales of an auto store, gathering information as customer´s, product´s and order´s. Regading ETL, the data was extracted from Kaggle and stored at SQL Server. 

## Analysis

### Power Bi 

Data can be visualized in the pbi dashboard, where it is described in terms of distinct factors as customers, countries etc. Different graph types are presented, as pie and bar charts, sales trends etc. DAX calculated KPI indicators, as average and total sales, are positioned upperly. Near them, there is a filter where data can be segmented according to selected country and order date. Two main measures were considered for the analysis, sales and orders, distributed in two separate dashboard pages. The dataset consists of 3 correlated tables, which comprehends the orders, customers and products lists. 


Tables:
- Orders: Orders list
- Customers: Customers list
- Products: Products list

### Data Model

Is presented below a screenshot of the data model. The data shows that Orders is connect to both Customers and Products.

### SQL 

Using tsql language at SQL Server, an analysis was made through a number of written
queries. These queries are able to return selected data , join tables, create indexes, views and so on. Data can be filtered via a wide set of sql commands, as WHERE, HAVING, LIKE, CASE, IN and using subqueries. TSQL (Transact-SQL) the procedural sql language of SQL Server, also possess a broad set of unique (commands), as variables, parameters, (and so on). 
### Summary

Observations are presented below: (lorger insights?) 

In terms of sales:

- Top countries were USA, Spain and France 
- Top productlines were classic and vintage cars 
- Top dealsizes were medium and large
- Top months were October and November 
- Top days would be within the first week of month

(In this dashboard, we can see company has generated total revenue in 4 years ₹ 985M, total profit margin ₹24.7M, Profit margin% 2.5%, Sales Qty ₹2M. in 2020 company has generated total revenue of ₹ 142M by selling a total of 350K and earned a profit of ₹ 2.1M.
In 4 years Delhi NCR is our largest market in terms of revenue with ₹ 520M and total contribution of 52.8% with total revenue but if you look at the profit margin Delhi NCR is generating only 2.3% profit margin.
If we check the profit margin then here In 2020 Bhubaneshwar comes into the picture which is generating the highest profit margin of 10.48%. Similarly, if we can check the Profit Contribution % by Market then here Mumbai is the largest player with 23.89% of total contribution in total profit.)
Summary:

- Avg of sales is 256
- Avg of days since last order is  1.8 thousand
- Avg of items per order is 6.5
- Avg of price per item is 8.9 thousand 
- Percentages of canceled orders is 2%

In terms of orders:

If we were to limit ourselves to USA, the results would be:

what to do next? in this way what we could do would be to see others, recommendations
